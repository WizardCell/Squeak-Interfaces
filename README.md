# Squeak Interfaces: Interfaces brought to Squeak, all with the help of Squeak's Reflection

This was an assignment part of OOP course. We add to Squeak a mechanism that will perform a type check on the arguments passed to methods, which are compiled in a way that the mechanism supports. More importantly, we add our own version of Interfaces to Squeak.

We make heavy use of Squeak's powerful reflection, to make all that possible.
